# Subtitles on your presentation deck

We want to make it a fun event for both the Japanese audience and those visiting Japan from overseas.
So please put "subtitles" to the slides in Japanese if you can.If you not, don't worry. The ScalaMatsuri staff will provide the translation.
もし可能ならば、スライドに日本語の字幕を入れて下さい。日本語がわからない場合でも、スタッフが翻訳をします。

# How to put "subtitles"

- [Building a Unified Data Pipline in Spark](http://www.slideshare.net/scalaconfjp/building-a-unified-data-pipline-in-spark)
- [The Evolution of Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/scalaconfjp/the-evolution-of-scala-scala)
- [Sample Deck (Keynote 09)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.key)
- [Sample Deck (PDF)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.pdf)
- [Sample Deck (PowerPoint)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.pptx)

Like the above sample decks, please create a black text box to fit **2 lines** in **36px font** (27pt on Windows, 36pt on Mac) at the bottom each slides.

## Submit your slides

Please submit your slide decks by February 18th to cfp2018@scalamatsuri.org .
Please send it as PowerPoint, Google slide show, or Keynote format. 
We recommend 4:3 aspect, but also 16:9 OK.

ScalaMatsuri staff will provide the translation, and also check for Code of Conduct compliance.
Since the translation will be done based on text, if you could submit a text file with all the texts along with your slide deck, it will be appreciated (like a lot)!
The slide deck will also be submitted to the interpreters.

If you have any changes by then, feel free to submit the new deck along with the change description such as "changed the text on page 3." Any changes after February 10th will be at your own risk.
